      bio:`I am a Construction Commercial and Claims Manager with more than twelve years of experience supporting large and complex projects across the UK and Europe. My background spans commercial management, contract negotiation, procurement, forensic quantum analysis and claims management, with a strong focus on ensuring that projects remain commercially protected, contractually compliant and financially controlled.

I began my career in project accounting, where I developed a deep understanding of cost structures, reporting mechanisms and financial governance. This foundation shaped the way I work today. Accuracy, commercial clarity and disciplined reporting remain central to my approach. As my career progressed, I moved into procurement, subcontract management and commercial leadership roles across major contractors and specialist engineering organisations. These positions strengthened my understanding of how commercial decisions influence delivery and how early intervention prevents disputes and protects margin.

Over the years, I have managed commercial teams, governed frameworks, led tender and estimating functions and overseen multimillion pound subcontract negotiations. I have supported both contractors and client organisations with commercial strategy, change management, claims preparation and dispute resolution under JCT and NEC forms. My academic and professional training is diverse, with qualifications spanning civil engineering, financial management, commercial and construction law, expert witness practice and international languages. This mix allows me to approach commercial issues from multiple perspectives and communicate confidently with stakeholders at every level.

I continue to work closely with project teams to strengthen commercial governance, improve reporting accuracy and support the successful resolution of complex claims. My focus remains consistent. To bring structure, clarity and dependable expertise to every commercial environment I work in and to support organisations with guidance that is informed, practical and rooted in both experience and evidence.
